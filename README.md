The sequence of operations goes like this:
A Seller puts Items (not watermarked) for sale, including some Bundles of items.
A Customer orders items and/or bundles in an Order, with complete Payment details.
The system contacts the PSP and gets a result, updating the Order and the Payment entities.
If the payment succeeded, then Watermarked Items are created for the customer (instead of the original Item Minecraft files), and a Download Limit is created as well.
The actual payment confirmation, the Invoice and various reportings are also generated by several batches on top of all that. Popularity for the items and for the seller are updated as well for the home page, by another batch.
